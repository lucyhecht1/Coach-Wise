# CoachWise: Making Coaching Accessible
**CoachWise** is an AI-powered web application designed to assist basketball coaches in creating, refining, and visualizing custom basketball plays. The site offers two core functionalities: creating **offensive plays** and/or **inbounds plays**, both tailored to your teamâ€™s specific needs.

* **Refinement:** Adjust plays dynamically, factoring in player performance (e.g., off shooting nights).
* **Download:** Export plays as a PDF, complete with diagrams and formatted details.
